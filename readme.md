# Space Invaders
This was my take on space invaders and it was a lot of fun. I learned a lot and also had my struggles along the way, but overall it worked out quite nicely.

There are defenitely a lot of flaws and bugs in the game but it works well and this is the first time for me making an actual game. By that I mean a main menu, settings, a sort of tutorial/explanation page, a score system and overall just a complete experience.

Everything you would need to know is explained in the games "Help" page in the Main menu.
